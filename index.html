      <h2><br>About Me<br></h2>

      <h6>
        I originally got my start in computer science in high school. I had an extremely talented teacher who introduced me to my first ever programming language, Java. Throughout the course of my high school career, I took three different computer science classes, including AP Computer Science, where I was able to score a 5 on the AP Computer Science Test (BC). I also competed in UIL Computer 
        Science and was a three time state medalist, scoring bronze, silver, and gold.<br><br>
        When choosing a university to attend, Texas A&M was the obvious choice. Both of my parents and older brother studied at Texas A&M. However, beyond that, the university is known for its excellent engineering program. In my first semester, I learned and became fluent in Python. Its simplicity and functionality was extremely appealing to me. I spent my second year focused on learning C++. 
        I found pointers and memory references challenging but interesting. Also in my second year, I have gained experience with Assembly, Racket, and C. I am excited to continue expanding on my knowledge here at Texas A&M. <br><br>
        While I have greatly enjoyed my time in class, I have also prioritized involvement on campus. My freshman year I was a member of FORME (Freshmen Organizing and Running Mixed Events). This is an all-freshmen organization that is 
        50% service and 50% social with the goal of giving freshmen a community and foundation on campus. Once freshman year ended, I looked for new opportunities to stay involved on campus such as being a Big Event Staff Assistant and 
        Fish Camp counselor for two summers. I applied for and was selected to be in RYLLIES (Respecting Yourself while demonstrating Leadership, Loyalty, Integrity, Excellence, and Selfless Service), a women's organization, the spring 
        of my sophomore year where I have gotten to partake in more community service and sisterhood events. I also wanted to be more involved in engineering, so I interviewed for and made it into SEC (Student Engineering Council). As 
        an SEC member, I have been able to advocate for engineering students and spread awareness about engineering programs. Specifically, I am in the Marketing Committee, so I 
        work primarily on the SEC Instagram which can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tamusec/" target="_blank" id="link">HERE</a>.<br><br>
        My campus involvement has helped me grow outside of the classroom in unimaginable ways. I have developed into a strong leader that prioritizes healthy communication. I pride myself in being authentic, confident, and open-minded. I aim to continue to stay involved 
        on campus to build these soft skills and simultaneously expand on my knowledge of Computer Science. With a rapidly expanding technology industry, I am eager 
        to get more hands-on experience and challenge myself with advanced projects. From software development to AI, I am fascinated 
        by every aspect of Computer Science, and here at Texas A&M, I am constantly taking steps everyday to prepare for my future.
