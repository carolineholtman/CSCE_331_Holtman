            <h2>Checkers</h2>
            <h4>In a team, we built and completed a working checkers 
              game in Python using Turtle graphics. After setting up the board visually, we moved on to
              coding the game to follow standard chess instructions. We implemented a two player version
              along with a one player mode to play against the computer program.

            <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <h4>As an introductory project to JavaFX, I built a working
              Tic Tac Toe game. I have previous Java experience from high school. However, this was
              my first time incorporating JavaFX and SceneBuilder to develop visuals. This was built as a two 
              player game. The game incorporates text displays which includes which turn it is and game results. 
              The game also keeps count of each player's wins.

            <h2>Wordle</h2>
            <h4>To build on my JavaFX experience, I then built a working Wordle game. 
              This game has a start page with rules, a game board, and stat board. I programmed the game to select a word randomly 
              from a complete list of every 5 letter word eligible for Wordle. The game then proceeds to work just as the New York Times Wordle 
              does. In the end, a stat board keeps track of the guess attempt number when won for each game, overall wins, and overall losses. 
              The stat board updates automatically and displays the results on the last page.

            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <h4>I built this website using HTML and CSS for styling. I initally started off with a sketch 
              of what I wanted each page to look like. Since this was my first time using HTML and CSS, I first focused a large portion 
              of time to learn the languages and features. Once I felt I had a good grasp on the basics, I started to code out the simpler elements. 
              As I advanced through the programming, I learned by trial-and-error to perfect my layout and elements.
