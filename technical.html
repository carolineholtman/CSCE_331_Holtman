            <h2>Checkers (2022)</h2>
            <h4>In a team, we built and completed a working checkers 
              game in Python using Turtle graphics. After setting up the board visually, we moved on to
              coding the game to follow standard chess instructions. A two player version was implemented 
              along with a one player mode to play against the computer program.

            <h2>Tic Tac Toe (2024)</h2>
            <h4>As an introductory project to JavaFX, I built a working
              Tic Tac Toe game. I have previous Java experience from high school. However, this was
              my first time incorporating JavaFX and SceneBuilder to develop visuals. This was built as a two 
              player game. The game incorporates text displays which include who's turn it is and game results. 
              The game also keeps count of each player's wins.

            <h2>Wordle (2024)</h2>
            <h4>To build on my JavaFX experience, I built a working Wordle game. 
              This game has a start page with rules, a game board, and stat board. I programmed the game to select a word randomly 
              from a complete list of every eligible 5 letter word. The game then proceeds to work just as the New York Times Wordle 
              does. In the final screen, a stat board keeps track of how many guesses it took to win each game, overall wins, and overall losses. 
              The stat board updates automatically with each game.

            <h2>Personal Website (2024)</h2>
            <h4>I built this website using HTML for the base code, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for toggling between styles. I initally started off with a sketch 
              of what I wanted each page to look like. Since this was my first time using HTML and CSS, I first focused a large portion 
              of time to learn the languages and features. Once I felt I had a good grasp on the basics, I started to code out the simpler elements. 
              As I advanced through the programming, I learned by trial-and-error to perfect my layout and elements. The project repository is linked to 
              the GitHub logo.
